== DESCRIPTION:

Repub is a simple minded HTML to ePub converter.

It lacks imagination and won't try to guess the source document structure, you will have to describe where to look
for title and table of contents. In return, it provides you with greater control over generated
ePub documents.

== FEATURES:

Repub accepts the following parameters:

* XPath expressions for source document title, toc, toc_item and toc_section
* XPath expressions for elements that will be removed from the converted document
* Regular expressions for editing the source document

Few examples:

* Project Gutenberg's THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES (with proper table of contents)

    repub -x 'title:div[@class='book']//h1' \
        -x 'toc://table' \
        -x 'toc_item://tr' \
	    http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext99/advsh12h.htm

This tells Repub to look for title in the first found H1 in the DIV of class "book"; that table of contents is
located in the first TABLE and TOC item can be found inside TR.
The above will produce readable ePub which can be further enhanced by removing some "noise" content: 

    repub -x 'title:div[@class='book']//h1' \
        -x 'toc://table' \
        -x 'toc_item://tr' \
        -X '//pre' -X '//hr' -X '//body/h1' -X '//body/h2' \
	    http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext99/advsh12h.htm

In addition to parsing, the above command also removes from the final version of document all PRE and HR elements,
and first H1 and H2 elements from the body.

A bit more complicated example:

* Git User's Manual

    repub -x 'title://h1' \
        -x 'toc://div[@class="toc"]/dl' \
        -x 'toc_item:dt' \
        -x 'toc_section:following-sibling::*[1]/dl' \
        -w git-manual \
        http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html

This tells Repub to look for title in the first found H1, for TOC in the DL element of the DIV with class "toc" and
that TOC items can be found inside DT elements. Additionally, TOC item can have a child TOC section inside DL when
DL element immediately follows DT. 

The above command also saves all XPath expressions as "git-manual" profile, which can be later reused to save keystrokes.
For example, if you later decide to regenerate Git Manual ePub without TOC at the beginning of document, you can do

    repub -l git-manual -X '//div[@class="toc"]' http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html

A few more examples:

* GNU Wget Manual

    repub -m 'creator:gnu.org' \
        -x 'title://h1' -x 'toc://div[@class="contents"]/ul' -x 'toc_item:li' -x 'toc_section:ul' \
        -X '//div[@class="contents"]' \
        http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/manual/wget.html

* Project Gutenberg's ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND

    repub -x 'title:body/h1' -x 'toc://table' -x 'toc_item://tr' -X '//pre' -X '//hr' -X '//body/h4' \
	    http://www.gutenberg.org/files/11/11-h/11-h.htm
